📌 Summary: PHP Sessions with HTML Forms
🎯 Objective

The objective is to understand how PHP sessions work, how to start a session, and how to store user information from an HTML form to keep data available across multiple pages.

1️⃣ What is a PHP Session?

A PHP session allows the server to store user data temporarily and reuse it on different pages.
It helps identify the same user while navigating the website.

2️⃣ Starting a Session

To use sessions, the session must be started at the very top of the PHP file:

session_start();


✔ Must be called before any HTML or output.

3️⃣ Using the $_SESSION Superglobal

$_SESSION is an array used to store and access session data.

Storing session data:
$_SESSION['username'] = $_POST['username'];

Reading session data:
echo $_SESSION['username'];

4️⃣ Session with HTML Form

User data is collected using an HTML form and saved into a session after basic validation.

<form method="POST">
  <input type="text" name="username">
  <button type="submit" name="submit">Login</button>
</form>

if (isset($_POST['submit']) && !empty($_POST['username'])) {
  $_SESSION['username'] = $_POST['username'];
}

5️⃣ Keeping Data Between Pages

Once stored, session data can be accessed on any page as long as the session is active.

session_start();
echo "Welcome " . $_SESSION['username'];

6️⃣ Destroying a Session (Logout)

To end a session and remove user data:

session_start();
session_unset();
session_destroy();


✔ Commonly used for logout functionality.

7️⃣ Best Practices for Session Management

Always call session_start() before output

Do not store sensitive data like passwords

Use sessions for authentication and user state

Destroy the session on logout

Check if session variables exist before using them

📌 Summary: PHP Cookies and Form Handling
🎯 Objective

The objective is to understand how to create, read, and delete cookies in PHP in order to temporarily store information on the client side and personalize the user experience.

1️⃣ What is a Cookie?

A cookie is a small piece of data stored in the user’s browser.
It is sent back to the server with each request and is mainly used to remember user preferences.

Examples of stored data:

Username

Language

Theme (dark/light)

2️⃣ Creating a Cookie with setcookie()

Cookies are created using the setcookie() function.

setcookie("username", "Ali", time() + 3600, "/");


Explanation:

"username" → cookie name

"Ali" → cookie value

time() + 3600 → expiration time (1 hour)

"/" → cookie path (available on the entire website)

⚠️ setcookie() must be called before any HTML output.

3️⃣ The Role of the Path /

The path defines where the cookie is accessible.

/ → cookie available on the entire website

/folder/ → cookie available only inside that folder

No path → cookie available only in the current directory

Best practice: use / if the cookie should be global.

4️⃣ Reading a Cookie with $_COOKIE

Cookies are read using the $_COOKIE superglobal.

if (isset($_COOKIE['username'])) {
  echo $_COOKIE['username'];
}


✔ Always check with isset() before reading a cookie.

5️⃣ Cookies with HTML Forms

User data can be collected from a form and stored in a cookie.

<form method="POST">
  <input type="text" name="username">
  <button type="submit" name="submit">Save</button>
</form>

if (isset($_POST['submit']) && !empty($_POST['username'])) {
  setcookie("username", $_POST['username'], time() + 3600, "/");
}

6️⃣ Deleting a Cookie

To delete a cookie, set its expiration time in the past.

setcookie("username", "", time() - 3600, "/");


✔ The browser will automatically remove it.

7️⃣ Cookie Expiration

Common expiration examples:

time() + 3600 → 1 hour

time() + 86400 → 1 day

time() + 604800 → 1 week

Shorter lifetimes improve security.

8️⃣ Best Practices for Cookies

Do not store sensitive data (passwords, tokens)

Always set a limited expiration time

Use cookies only for simple data

Always check existence with isset()

Cookies are less secure than sessions

📄 Summary: PHP Form Validation with Conditional Messages
🎯 Educational Objective

The objective of this project is to validate a form using PHP and display feedback messages based on user input, without using a database.

🧩 Step 1: Form Submission (HTML)

An HTML form is created with three fields: Full Name, Email, and Message.

The form uses the POST method to send data securely.

A submit button allows the user to send the form data.

🧩 Step 2: Form Detection (PHP)

PHP checks if the form was submitted using $_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] === "POST".

This ensures that validation is executed only after form submission.

🧩 Step 3: Data Retrieval and Cleaning

User inputs are retrieved from $_POST.

The trim() function is used to remove extra spaces from the beginning and end of inputs.

🧩 Step 4: Validation Logic

PHP checks if any field is empty.

PHP validates the email format using filter_var().

Based on the validation result, a message is prepared (error or success).

🧩 Step 5: Conditional Message Display

The message is displayed only if it exists.

If there is a validation error, an error message is shown.

If all inputs are valid, a success message is shown.

🧠 Final Result

Empty fields → error message.

Invalid email → error message.

Valid inputs → success message.

The project focuses on validation and conditional display, without database interaction.
